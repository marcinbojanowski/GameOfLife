Hello!

This is Web-based Object-Oriented PHP implementation of famous Conway's "Game of Life" concept.

Scripts require at least PHP 5.4 version and GD library.

I believe code is self explained so I added only few comments
and general descriptions for each class explaining basic concepts. 

Unit tests are based on PHPUnit framework included in phpunit.phar file. 
Test are based on 2 crucial classes - ConwayRules and Universe, 
the rest are based on these or are very basic 
so i don't believe its necessary to write unit tests for them.

For GIF animation i used 3rd party class found on stackoverflow.com

User-experience:
User comes to index.php, he can choose between 2 universes: 
first randomly generated and second predefined (Gosper's Glider Gun).
After click on one of these, user is redirected to another page, 
that includes newly-generated GIF image. Universe of the game is borderless
but due to GIF limitations image displays only "window" between location (0,0) and (37,37). 
Image displays first 300 iterations of life-cycle.

Feel free to comment my work - all feedback are welcome!

PS. Code is also available on my github:
